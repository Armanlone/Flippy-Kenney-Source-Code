# Flippy Kenney Source Code

## About:
Flippy Kenney is a physics-ragdoll adventure game.

Made for Kenney Jam 2021 with the theme of: Rotation.

A short slapstick adventure of a dummy.

It is about the dummy, "Kenney", trying to reach the goal (or flag) by the help of the cursor, and that's you player.

Try to put your cursor towards Kenney and watch it fly!
